# Next.js tutorial for a SSR blog app

This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

## Deployed link to see what it ends like

## My 2 cents
If you have worked with React and done some back end,
this might come pretty easy to you as it's a weird hybrid.

The tutorial was well pointed and good explinations to the why and what you are doing,
with plenty of links for more depth to a subject.
